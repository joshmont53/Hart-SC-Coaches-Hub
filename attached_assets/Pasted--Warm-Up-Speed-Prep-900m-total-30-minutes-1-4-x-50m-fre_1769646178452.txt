**Warm-Up (Speed Prep) – 900m total, ≤30 minutes**

1) 4 x 50m freestyle, easy, 15-20s rest  
Focus: long body line, soft kicking, rocket-ship streamline off each wall to at least 3m, nose bubbles

2) 4 x 50m as 25m drill + 25m swim, 20s rest  
Choice drills: freestyle 3-3-3 or single-arm with board in front; backstroke single-arm with good shoulder roll; breaststroke kick on back for timing  
Keep strokes smooth, then “copy the drill” on the swim 25

3) 6 x 25m kick, 20-25s rest  
First 3 on front with board (freestyle kick), next 3 on back (no board), steady legs, toes pointed, hips near the surface

4) 4 x 50m as 25 easy + 25 fast (choice: free or back), 30s rest  
Easy lengthen into the fast 25; fast part at good tempo with quick turn and tight streamline

5) 6 x 25m speed primers, 30-40s rest  
To 15m fast, then easy to the wall; alternate free and back  
Fast part = race kick and fast hands, push start only, hit a tight streamline every rep


**Notes for delivery**

- Keep the two swimmers leaving 5 seconds apart to reduce drafting and allow individual feedback.  
- If technique breaks on the fast parts, shorten the fast distance (to 12.5m) and keep quality high.  
- Estimated timing: Set 1 ~5 minutes, Set 2 ~6 minutes, Set 3 ~6 minutes, Set 4 ~6 minutes, Set 5 ~6-7 minutes (total ≤30 minutes).


**Why this suggestion?**

- The squad is 8-9 years old, so the warm-up builds gradually from easy swimming to drills, then kicking, and only then short fast efforts. This keeps instructions simple and age-appropriate while protecting technique.  
- Today’s focus is speed, so the set includes controlled builds (25 easy + 25 fast) and 15m speed primers to raise tempo without fatigue, ideal for a 25m pool.  
- Recent training emphasized technique, and the squad’s typical sessions average ~3025m; a 900m warm-up sits comfortably within that volume and maintains technical quality before main speed work.  
- With only two swimmers, rest ranges are short and manageable, allowing more feedback and ensuring the warm-up fits within 30 minutes.
